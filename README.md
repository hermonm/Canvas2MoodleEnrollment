# Canvas to Moodle Student Enrollment
Each year every teacher resets their Moodle Course Shell and then enrolls next year's students. Some of us go ahead and manually enroll all of them ourselves, some use the group choice activity and some use the easy enrollment code methods. This program works by generating a CSV file from your Canvas Course and then redirecting you to a Bulk Enrollment Page on your Moodle Course where you will then upload the file.
